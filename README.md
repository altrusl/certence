## Description

Unlike just a list of questions this app allows to tag questions, filter them, make notes.

The main idea is that the best way to prepare to the certification is to take practice tests.

It can be assumed that an averagely trained user could confidently answer about 60% of the questions in the test question bank, for 30% he needs some research (but after going through them several times he will definitely remember them), and the remaining 10% are the tricky questions, they require additional study and investigation.

The first type questions the user wants to go through once and then forget about them so that they no longer appear in the list and do not take up his attention and time.

The second ones should be passed several times, and for the third ones the user needs a convenient space for notes, links and other stuff.

This is how we come to **tags** and **question filtering**

There are three preset tags for test questions - "*Easy*", "*Complex*", "*Intricate*". User can create custom tags as well, for example - "*Outdated*", "*Incorrect*", "*S3*", "*Persistence*"

It is possible to filter questions by several tags - for example, to show only "*Complex*" and "*S3*" questions

## Use-case

So a typical use-case would be that a user goes through all the questions once, applying tags. After that he forgets about "*Easy*" questions. If in the test there are, say, 300 questions, that means about 200 of them are filtered out. They will no longer take up user attention and time.

Then he goes through "*Complex*" ones several times. And the "*Intricate*" questions he, perhaps, might even skip - if there are not so many of them and the passing score is low enough.

**This approach saves a lot of time and effort during certification preparation**

## Tests and questions

Right now it contains only SAA related questions, but it's possible to add many other certification practice test questions - check out "**Where to get more certification practice tests?**" link on the main page.
